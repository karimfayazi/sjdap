# Mobile App Setup Guide

## 🎯 Recommendation: **Capacitor** (Best Choice)

### Why Capacitor for Your Application:

✅ **Native App Experience** - Your users will get a real app from App Store/Play Store  
✅ **Better Performance** - Native rendering, faster than web view  
✅ **Full Device Access** - Camera, GPS, File System, Background Sync  
✅ **Offline Support** - Better local storage and data sync capabilities  
✅ **Professional** - Field workers prefer native apps over web apps  
✅ **Push Notifications** - Native push notifications support  

### Your App Needs:
- Data entry forms (Family Profile, QOL-Baseline, etc.)
- Offline data collection
- Document uploads (may need camera)
- Professional field worker use case

## 🚀 Quick Start: PWA First (Then Upgrade to Capacitor)

I recommend starting with PWA to test quickly, then upgrading to Capacitor for production.

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Test immediately** on mobile devices
2. **Get user feedback** quickly
3. **Upgrade to Capacitor** when ready
4. **Minimal code changes** needed

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: PWA Setup (1-2 hours)
- Add PWA manifest
- Add service worker for offline support
- Test on mobile browsers
- "Add to Home Screen" functionality

### Phase 2: Capacitor Setup (1-2 days)
- Install Capacitor
- Configure for iOS & Android
- Add native plugins as needed
- Build and test native apps
- Publish to app stores

## 🎬 What Would You Like Me To Do?

1. **Set up PWA now** (Quick start, test immediately)
2. **Set up Capacitor** (Full native app)
3. **Set up both** (PWA first, then Capacitor)

Let me know and I'll implement it!
